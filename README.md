# TicTacToe
## Requirements
Build a two player tic tac toe app where a game is played by alternating clicks until the game is won by X, O or is a tie.
## How to run the game
1. Clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/jiangxiaoxuan/tic-tac-toe.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `ng serve --open` 
## Some highlight features
1. There is message on top of the game board to indicate current player's turn
2. When the game end with any one of "X win" "O win" and "tie", no more changes or clicks will be allowed
3. Restart the game by clicking the "reset" button
## Features to be implemented
1. Fully responsive board
2. Multiple games to be played at the same time
3. Select which player goes first (now "X" will always start first)

## Play Board Preview

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
